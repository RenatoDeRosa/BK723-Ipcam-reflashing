# BK7252-Ipcam-reflashing
this repository is going to illustrate the process of "hardware hacking" of a small chinese ip cam with a A9_B V1.3_220516 with a BK7252 chip, as well as providing information manual and resource to explore the basic of the various component;
to start using this repository as the center of your information gathering for learning you only need the basic thing:
1
  A UART to USB device to connect to the uart (you can use a device that already have a such chip, for example a esp8266 or a arduino) the chip that you are looking for are cp210x or ch340g;
this repository is aimed to everyone that want to approch the world of hardware hacking on small Chinese device
(i'm a newby myself)

UPDATE:
 i broke my camera by changing the ip of the camera, it connect to the app v730 but doesn't stream any image, if someone have any advice i will be gratefull
